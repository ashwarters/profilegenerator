  ## Installation
  From my GitHub repository you can clone the source code, and then run an npm install jest and npm inquirer in your terminal.
  
  
  ## Usage
  Once you have installed each npm package, you can run the tests that are in the repo by opening the terminal in the root of your project and type 'npm run test'. After all 4 tests pass, you can then run 'node index.js' to start the CLI prompts. You will be directed to use your arrow keys to select list menu items, use all letter and number keys to enter question prompts, and the 'enter' key to submit each of your responses.
